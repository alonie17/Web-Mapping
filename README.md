For Map 2 I decided to work with some Seattle crime data. It was challenging at first for me to locate the data at first
and I had to go in manually to the CSV file and rename some headings so TileMill would be able to pick
up the data and provide points.  I provided the zoom level scaling while adding in some background color for 
King County.  I also went and found two seperate files, one of King County Precincts that would allow 
a more localized view of crime in the city.  I also had to find and adjust the Seattle City border.  I increased the
line width and created a visual border.  
For Map 3, I decided to take tornado touch down data and map the points over states.  This map hit home for
me a bit, for I had a lot of family affected by this particular series of unfortunate weather events.  
My intentions with this map was to create an interactive map that showcased the magnitude of the tornados,
on a F-0 --- F-5 scale, and map out any (if any) correlations between the location and the recovery effort.  
I used CSV data from NOAA's Severe Weather GIS Office which has a massive amount of data available
on all different types of weather events.  These weather events range from lightning touchdown points, 
to wildfire locations.  I begin by adding the data to my map, following up with adding some color to the markers
and placing a nice shapefile of US states over the map.  I adjusted the border width of the state lines and
decieded to adjust the zoom level.  The styling choices I chose to make were the addition of a hypsometric tint
showing a "heat" map (if you will) of the areas of states that were increasingly affected.  My reasoning for
showing different detail at differentiating zoom levels was simple, for I wanted to show which tornados affected
which particular road ways.  My intentions with this map were to show families affected/aid responders which areas 
may need increased help.  I actually really enjoyed doing this lab.  Even though it was rather difficult and challenging
at times, TileMill turned out to be one of my favorite programs we've used so far this quarter.  It seemed both applicable 
to GIS Skills along with providing a visual representation to which areas were hit the hardest (particularly in Eastern Louisiana).  
Tile Mill proved to be VERY interesting!
